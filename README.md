## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body is unable to regulate the amount of sugar in the blood. Early detection and management are crucial to preventing complications. This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various health indicators such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Alternatively, you can install all the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KNN_Diabetes_Classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd KNN_Diabetes_Classification
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook KNN_Diabetes_classification.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. 

### Example Output
- Accuracy: 85%
- Precision: 82%
- Recall: 88%

Visualizations of the results and decision boundaries are also included.
